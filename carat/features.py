    Notes

    The accentuation feature is organized into a feature map. First, the feature signal is
    time-quantized to the rhythm metric structure by considering a grid of tatum pulses equally
    distributed within the annotated beats. The corresponding feature value is taken as the maximum
    within window centered at the frame closest to each tatum instant. This yields feature vectors
    whose coordinates correspond to the tatum pulses of the rhythm cycle (or bar). Finally, a
    feature map of the cycle-length rhythmic patterns of the audio file is obtained by building a
    matrix whose columns are consecutive feature vectors.
    
    Based on the feature map introduced in [1].

    The code of this function is based on the universal peak-picking method of the madmom library.
    
    Following a method proposed in [1] and later modified in [2], a set of simple peak
    selection rules are implemented in which onset candidates, apart from being a
    local maximum, have to exceed a threshold that is a combination of a fixed and an
    adaptive value.

    The accentuation feature function has to fulfil the following two conditions:

    ..math:: F(n) = \;\,\max\left\{SF(n-\hat{\omega}_{\textrm{pre}}:n+\hat{\omega}_{\textrm{pos}})\right\}
    ..math:: F(n) &\geq \textrm{mean}\left\{SF(n-\bar{\omega}_{\textrm{pre}}:n+\bar{\omega}_{\textrm{pos}})\right\} + \delta

    where delta is a fixed threshold and the omega parameters determine the width of the moving average and moving maximum filters, 
    i.e. the number of previous (pre) and subsequent (pos) points involved.
